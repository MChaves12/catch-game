# Catch Game
This is a short and simple avoider game with a little extra touch, where the player has to catch objectives while avoiding obstacles.
This entire game was made with vanila JS, and some HTML and CSS.This is my first project in the IronHack bootcamp.
The Catch Game has a Football Theme, cuz i love sports, but with just a little changes you can moded for the sport that you want, including quidditch hahaha.
